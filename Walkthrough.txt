Walkthrough - Project Initialization
I have successfully initialized the project structure for both Backend and Frontend.

Backend
Stack: Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Prisma (MySQL).
Structure: Modular architecture (src/modules, src/core, src/config).
Database: Prisma schema created matching the provided specification.
Fix: Removed block comments /* ... */ from schema as they are not supported by Prisma.
Fix: Added missing relation creditRecoveriesDelivery in 
User
 model to match CreditRecovery.
Auth: JWT Authentication middleware and service implemented.
Build: Verified with npm run build.
Frontend
Stack: React, Vite, TypeScript.
Structure: Standard React structure (src/pages, src/components, src/context).
Auth: 
AuthContext
 and axios interceptors set up for JWT management (access + refresh tokens).
Routing: react-router-dom setup with Protected Routes.
Build: Verified with npm run build.
Next Steps
Database Migration: Run npx prisma migrate dev to create tables in your local MySQL database.
Frontend Development: Build out the UI pages (Dashboard, Inventory, etc.).
Backend Development: Implement remaining services and controllers.
Verification Results
Backend Build: Success.
Frontend Build: Success.
